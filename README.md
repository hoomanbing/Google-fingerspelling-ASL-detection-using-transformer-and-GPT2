# Google-fingerspelling-ASL-detection-using-transformer-and-GPT2

## Objectives
1) To introduce ASLTranscribe, a potent transformer-based paradigm for ASL finger-spelling recognition and effectively recognize individual ASL letters, translating them into tokens that represent words and phrases.
2) To utilize the transformer model in conjunction with GPT-2 to generate meaningful, contextually relevant sentences, overcoming the challenge of translating finger-spelled words into intelligible utterances.
3) To evaluate the systemâ€™s performance using training and validation loss for model optimization and BLEU and WER scores for phrase generation with fluency and accuracy.
